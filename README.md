# The Simon Game

---

## Introduction to the Simon Game Challenge
In this challenge, you will be building a game modeled after the classic game Simon. The gameplay begins when you press any key to start, and the game will display a tile that you need to click on.

As you progress from level to level, the patterns become increasingly complex. Eventually, you will make a mistake, at which point the game will notify you that you have made an error and the game will be over. You can then press any key to restart the game.

This challenge will test skills and knowledge in JavaScript and jQuery.
